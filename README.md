# Underwater Acoustic Communication using BFSK

## Overview
This project presents the design and simulation of an underwater acoustic digital communication system using Binary Frequency Shift Keying (BFSK). The system is implemented in MATLAB Simulink and models realistic underwater channel conditions.

## System Architecture
- BFSK Transmitter
- Underwater Acoustic Channel
  - Rician fading
  - Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN)
- BFSK Receiver with frequency detection
- BER performance evaluation

## Key Features
- Binary Frequency Shift Keying modulation
- Rician multipath fading channel modeling
- AWGN noise analysis
- Bandpass filtering and AGC
- Frequency detection using Goertzel algorithm
- BER analysis under varying SNR conditions

## Simulation Tools
- MATLAB
- Simulink

## Results
The system demonstrates reliable data transmission under underwater channel conditions. BER performance degrades gracefully with decreasing SNR, validating the robustness of BFSK modulation for underwater communication.

## Applications
- Underwater sensor networks
- Oceanographic data transmission
- Defense and submarine communications
- Marine monitoring systems
